# Flask Adventure Game Documentation

## Overview

This document provides an overview and explanation of the Flask-based adventure game application. The application simulates an interactive adventure game where users make choices that affect the outcome of the story.

## Components

### Imports

- `Flask`: A micro web framework for Python used to create the web application.
- `render_template`: A function from Flask used to render HTML templates.
- Custom modules:
  - `get_consent`: Handles user consent to start the adventure.
  - `get_adventurers_name`: Retrieves the adventurer's name.
  - `get_direction`: Determines the direction the adventurer chooses.
  - `get_your_age`: Checks the adventurer's age.
  - `get_cave_entrance`: Manages the decision to enter a cave.
  - `get_treasure_chest`: Handles the decision to open a treasure chest.

### Flask Application

- `app = Flask(__name__)`: Initializes the Flask application.

### Routes

#### Home Route

- **Path**: `/`
- **Methods**: `GET`, `POST`
- **Function**: `home()`

  - **Description**: The main route of the application where the adventure begins.
  - **Logic**:
    - Calls `get_consent()` to check if the user wants to start the adventure.
    - If consent is given, the game proceeds with a series of prompts and decisions:
      - Retrieves the adventurer's name.
      - Describes the initial scenario in the forest.
      - Asks the user to choose a direction: `straight`, `left`, or `right`.
      - Based on the direction, different scenarios unfold, including age verification and decisions about entering a cave or opening a treasure chest.

### HTML Template

- **Template**: `result.html`
- **Purpose**: Displays the result of the adventure based on user choices.

## Running the Application

To run the application, execute the script using Python. Ensure that Flask is installed in your environment.

```bash
python FlaskImport.py










The application will start a local web server, and you can access the game by navigating to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.

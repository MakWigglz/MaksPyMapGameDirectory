# Building the documentation
## To build the documentation, follow the steps in one of the sections below. You can view the documentation after building the HTML by opening the file Doc/build/html/index.html in a web browser.

## Note

## The following instructions all assume your current working dir is the Doc subdirectory in your CPython repository clone. Make sure to switch to it with cd Doc if necessary.

## Create a virtual environment
## You can create a new venv with the required dependencies using:


### Unix/macOS
make venv
### Building the docs with make will automatically use this environment without you having to activate it.


### Windows: Build using make / make.bat

### Unix/macOS A Unix Makefile is provided, Doc/Makefile.


### Windows
### To build the docs as HTML, run:


### Unix/macOS
### make html
